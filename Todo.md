# Agenda Group 1a

### Monday 3 February
- Division into groups
- Familiarisation with visibility tools

### Tuesday 4 February
- Get familiar with ESO exposure time calculator^[www.eso.org/observing/etc]
- Estimate expousre times for all the targets in the target list (`targets/Targets.csv`)
- Check that all targets are observable during the nights of February 10 and 11 (see jupyter notebook as well)
- Preliminary target lists for which we want to prepare OBs and which to observe with EFOSC and DFOSC

### Wednesday 5 February
- Decide which calibrations need to be taken
  - during the day, and
  - during the night
    - reference for standard star fields: https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/efosc/doc/PhotStds.pdf
- Preparation of OBs with the ESO p2 tool^[https://www.eso.org/p2ls/login]
- Preparation of target list with DFOSC
  - estimation of overheads
  - creation of finding charts
- Preparation of the calibration OBs and selection of standard fields for DFOSC
- Filter lists for EFOSC and DFOSC

### Thursday 6 February
- ESO archival data in case of bad weather
- Preparation of back-up targets:
  - See for example here for very bright galaxies: http://www.ls.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/efosc/Gallery/
  - You can also query NED or SIMBAD in a given RA, dec range for galaxies with visual mag of 10 < V < 11.

### Friday 7 February
- Familiarisation with the EFOSC2 data reduction: 
  - Manual: ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/dfs/pipelines/instruments/efosc/efosc-pipeline-manual-1.1.pdf
  - Tutorial for reducing imaging data: ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/dfs/pipelines/instruments/efosc/efosc-img-reflex-tutorial-1.1.pdf
- Familiarisation with IRAF tools
  - In case you never have used it, here is a neat overview of its functionalities: http://mips.as.arizona.edu/~khainline/intro_to_IRAF.html
- Ellipse fitting with photutils

### Before our first night:
- Do we have finding charts for all targets?
  - EFOSC2?
  - DFOSC?
- Do we have an observation schedule for each of the nights and the ?
- Make a Calibration plan:
  - Bias in the afternoon / morning
  - Domeflats in the afternoon / morning
  - Flatfields in the evening (6 filters at EFOSC, 5 Filters at DFOSC, coordinate with the other groups)
  - Standard stars in coordination with group 1a
- Who copies the data from DFOSC? (The EFOSC2 data will be in the ESO archive to be downloaded right away)
